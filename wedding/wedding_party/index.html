They met when they were just tiny babies and grew up together, sharing so many memories over the years. Some of their favorites are spending holidays together (Christmas in particular), and going on road trips to fun places! </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Eden Gose" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/eden.jpg> <h2>Eden Gose</h2> <h3>Bridesmaid</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Eden and Katie have been besties ever since they were babies. Some favorite memories that they share together are playing dress up and cooking in the kitchen when they were little, going on fun family vacations during the summer, pigging out on all the food they love to eat together and all the fun times in between! </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Sam Wiles" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/sam.jpg> <h2>Sam Wiles</h2> <h3>Bridesmaid</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Sam and Katie were always the cousins that were so close they were like sisters. They spent the years always embarrassing themselves at family parties, or sitting and talking about life (their favorite)! </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Emily Wiles" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/emily.jpg> <h2>Emily Wiles</h2> <h3>Bridesmaid</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Emily and Katie are cousins and have always been close over the years. The funniest memory they shared together was when Emily’s older cousin pushed Katie into a pile of leaves (on camera, of course) and all the memories they created when they went on their family trip to Wyoming! </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Molli Curry" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/molli.jpg> <h2>Molli Curry</h2> <h3>Bridesmaid</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Molli and Katie’s relationship has always been a wild one. Over the 15+ years of knowing each other, the memories have been nothing short of crazy adventures, like making “grass and berry soup” (ask them how to make it, you won’t regret it), sharing a locker in 6th grade, going through hot girl summer together, and all the fun in between! </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Lauren Nunez" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/lauren.jpg> <h2>Lauren Nunez</h2> <h3>Bridesmaid</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Lauren and Katie have been “BFFS4L” ever since they became next door neighbors over 17 years ago. A bunch of memories were made when they moved in together back in 2019 and adopted Miso, and also going to Hawaii and having fun there! </p> </div></div> <div class=flex-col><div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Matthew Schaaf" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/matthew.jpg> <h2>Matthew Schaaf</h2> <h3>Best Man</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Matthew and Spencer have been best friends for over 12 years after meeting in 6th grade. They shared many classes but had the most fun in band. Matthew’s best memories with Spencer come from the time they spent during middle school band camp at UNL. </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Zak Keck" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/zak.jpg> <h2>Zak Keck</h2> <h3>Groomsman</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Zak and Spencer met as freshman in college in the UNL Marching Band. After getting stuck sitting next to Spencer, what Zak thought would be the most annoying 13 hour bus ride of his life ended up giving him one of his closest friends. Spencer and Zak roomed together for a few years in college, and Zak takes credit for introducing Spencer to computer programming. </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Syrus Bomberger" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/syrus.jpg> <h2>Syrus Bomberger</h2> <h3>Groomsman</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Syrus and Spencer went to high school together and always had a similar friend group. They became closer friends after sharing computer science classes in college. Syrus and Spencer competed together multiple times at the UNL Hackathon and won prizes for their acclaimed programs RecycloBot and coder_royale. </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Nick Cowles" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/nicholas.jpg> <h2>Nick Cowles</h2> <h3>Groomsman</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Nick and Spencer became good friends in high school marching band. Spencer would often make goofy jokes while waiting for instructions from Mr. Metteer. Nick could never hold back laughter long enough to avoid attention, and would get called out in front of the entire band. They became known for this and it was increasingly challenging to avoid the constant embarrassment from Mr. Metteer. </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Chase Grossman" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/chase.jpg> <h2>Chase Grossman</h2> <h3>Groomsman</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>As Spencer’s older cousin, Chase has known Spencer his entire life. They would spend countless days in the summer playing football, basketball, and of course Xbox. Chase and Spencer have always been extremely close, you may have even mistaken them to be brothers. </p> </div> <div class="svelte-hliwjl wedding-party-card"><img alt="Drew Stream" class="svelte-hliwjl circle-img" src=./wedding_party/drew.jpg> <h2>Drew Stream</h2> <h3>Groomsman</h3> <p class=svelte-ggpow4>Drew is Spencer’s younger brother, and has always looked up to Spencer as his greatest role model. They always had a lot of fun together on family vacations to Colorado, Tennessee, and amusement parks around the country. Drew may be the cooler of the two brothers, but don’t let their differences distract you from their love for each other. </p> </div></div> </div> <div class="svelte-1fpktrr flower-rail right"><div class="svelte-1fpktrr flowers top"></div> <div class="svelte-1fpktrr flowers middle"></div> <div class="svelte-1fpktrr flowers bottom"></div> </div> </main> </main></div>
